simple reference implementation of GraphSAGE.

Requirements
------------
- requests

```bash
pip install requests
```


Results
-------

### Full graph training

Run with following (available dataset: "cora", "citeseer", "pubmed")
```bash
python3 train_full.py --dataset cora --gpu 0    # full graph
```

* cora: ~0.8330 
* citeseer: ~0.7110
* pubmed: ~0.7830

### Minibatch training for node classification

Train w/ mini-batch sampling for node classification on OGB-products:

```bash
python3 node_classification.py
python3 multi_gpu_node_classification.py
```

### Minibatch training for link prediction

Train w/ mini-batch sampling for link prediction on OGB-Citation2:

```bash
python3 link_pred.py
```
